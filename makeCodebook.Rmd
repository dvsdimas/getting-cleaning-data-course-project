Dataset structure
-----------------

```{r}
str(tidy.data)
```


Few rows of the dataset from head and tail
------------------------------------------

```{r}
head(tidy.data)

tail(tidy.data)
```

Summary of variables
--------------------

```{r}
summary(tidy.data)
```

Save to file
------------

Save tidy.data objects to a tab-delimited text file called `tidydata.txt`.

```{r}
f <- file.path(output_folder, "tidydata.txt")
write.table(tidy.data, f, quote = FALSE, sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE)
```
